# Balatro on the web with saves fixed I think.

All I did was ask AI to fix it and it looks like it worked. It needs more testing but it seems to be an ok fix for right now. All credit goes to the original creator on which I forked the repo to fix it.

## Short tutorial.

You need a .exe or .love file from the balatro from your pc. for android devices they will need to be rooted.

If you decide to make it portable you cannot share it as its illegal as it has balatro assets.

# Saving

The best way to save from my experience. Is refreshing the page before you close it. It just works for some reason.
